# ServiceLocator
- A (very) simple ServiceLocator solution for updated (see IUpdatableService) and non-updated (see IService) services objects.
- Allows clients to register, unregister and get services.
- Services can be automatically registered by being added to the same GameObject as the ServiceLocator or manually with the ServiceLocator::Register method.
